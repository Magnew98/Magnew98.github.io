				<h3>Automatic Encryption</h3>
				<p>
				When this app is downloaded it will ask for permission to access your messages. 
				Once it has access to your messages it will encrypt your previous and future messages. 
				But not to worry as no one other than the appwill be able to read your messages. 
				The app will even encrypt it so that programmers won't be able to read it aswell. 
				his is to keep your messages as private as possible. Also if you are not comfortable with this 
				feature you could always turn it off. 
				</p>

				<a name='results'></a>
				<h3>Lock Apps</h3> 
				<p>
				This app will also give you the choice of locking selected apps. This was no one other 
				than you can access the apps you've locked. The only two ways to unlock the selected app is to 
				either enter your passcode or use finger recognition. Most of the phones today have this capability 
				already built in to them 
				</p>

				<a name='exp'></a>
				<h3>General Security</h3>
				<p>
				Apart from locking apps and encrypting messages, this app 
				also handles general security. It is able to detect viruses and malware
				and delete them. It also checks for spyware so that you are sure you are the only 
				one with access to the information on your phone
				</p>
				
				<a name='quals'></a>
				<h3>Retina Scanner</h3>
				<p>
				An extra security benefit is also added when you pay an additional one euro. 
				The extra security benefit is a 
				retina scanner. With this feature instead of the basic number combination to 
				unlock your phone and your apps, 
				you will instead be able to unlock both phone and apps with your eye. 
				This feature works by taking 10 pictures 
				of your eye. It then takes notes of the features of your eye. 
				To unlock your phone or apps, you simply have to take a picture of your eye. 
				If it matches it will unlock.
